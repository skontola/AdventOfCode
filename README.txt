Advent of code is an advent calendar with coding challenges.
This folder contains my solutions.
Since there is a new challenge everyday, the solutions are not all that complex or tidy.

Files called "task#.txt" contain the task description.
Files called "input#.txt" contain the input values.
Files called "day#" contain the solution.
